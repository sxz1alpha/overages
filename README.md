The goal of this app it to sort through the mass of information that the government has on citizents it owes money.

The MVP allows a user to create account, log in and add potential clients to the overage hotlist manually. With a clean easy to navigate interface
users can eaisly see potential clients and all the information the government has on them.

## Technologies

This application uses Node.JS, JQuery, Bootstrap, bcrypt, express, handlebars, dotenv, sequelize, and sequelize session.
It also uses a pdf-extraction  module that will allow users to drag and drop whole pdf files into the hotlist. This feature will come at a later date.

## Future Development

The end goal for this application is to use web scrapers to query the government databases where the data is stored, have it skiptrace the leads through social media or ancestry.com then send out automated emails to defendants who are owed money. these defendants will then be able to log in, fill out the applicable paperwork and submit it through overages to the tax commissioner. thust streamlining the process of getting money back into the hands of the citizens it belongs to.
